# Final Project: Shadle 
## A wordle-inspired game using colors.
Shadle is a color-based guessing game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated color sequence within a limited number of attempts.

## Features 
Gameplay: Players have six chances to guess a secret four-color sequence.   
Color Selection: Choose colors from six choices to form your guess.   
Feedback: Receive feedback on each guess to refine your guess.   

## Built with
- Pygame library
- Random module
- Sys module

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository to your local.
2. Navigate to the directory in terminal or command prompt.
3. In terminal or command prompt, enter the following to install pygame: ```pip install pygame```
4. Run the game in terminal with the command: ```python final_main.py```.

## Instructions
First, select the play button.   
Then, guess a sequence of four colors by pressing any of the six colors at the bottom.   
After, press delete to remove a guess and enter to submit your guess.   
Then, the accuracy of the guess will be displayed.   
Finally, pressing the continue button will allow another guess.   
In the end, a player will either run out of guesses or guess the correct sequence.   
Repeat!
